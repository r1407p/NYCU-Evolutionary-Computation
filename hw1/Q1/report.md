# The Eight Queens Problem

## (a) How big is the phenotype space for the eight queens problem?

The phenotype space for the eight queens problem means the number of all possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard. The total number of configurations is computed by considering that each of the 8 queens must be placed on a unique row and a unique column without attacking each other.

The size of the phenotype space, which includes all potential configurations (including invalid ones), is:
64 * 63 * 62 * ... * 58 * 57 $\approx$ 1.78 * $10^{14}$ (if consider the queens are different)

64 * 63 * 62 * ... * 58 * 57 / 8! $\approx$ 4.42 * $10^{9}$ (if consider the queens are same)

However, if we consider only valid placements (where no two queens can attack each other), the count is significantly smaller. The exact number of valid solutions to the eight queens problem is **92**.

## (b) Give a genotype to encode the 8x8 chessboard configuration.

One common genotype representation for the eight queens problem is using a **permutation-based encoding**. We can represent the positions of the queens by a list of integers where the index of each element represents the row, and the value of the element represents the column position of the queen.

For example, the list:
\[ [1, 5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 4] \]
would mean:
- Queen in row 1 is placed in column 1.
- Queen in row 2 is placed in column 5.
- Queen in row 3 is placed in column 8.
- Queen in row 4 is placed in column 6.
- Queen in row 5 is placed in column 3.
- Queen in row 6 is placed in column 7.
- Queen in row 7 is placed in column 2.
- Queen in row 8 is placed in column 4.

This representation ensures that no two queens are in the same row, and the specific values guarantee no two queens are in the same column.

## (c) How big is the genotype space you give in (b)?

The size of the genotype space in this permutation-based encoding is equal to the number of permutations of 8 distinct columns. Therefore, the size of the genotype space is:
8! = 40,320

This means there are 40,320 possible configurations for placing the queens on the board using this encoding.

## (d) Briefly describe why the proposed genotype is able to cover the phenotype space.

The proposed genotype is able to cover the phenotype space because it explicitly represents the positions of the queens such that no two queens are in the same row or column. This directly maps to the requirements of the eight queens problem, where each queen must be positioned uniquely on the board to avoid being attacked.

Using permutation-based encoding ensures that we only generate configurations that respect the non-attacking constraints for rows and columns. Although diagonal conflicts are not directly prevented by this representation, they can be checked and filtered easily during the evaluation process. Thus, the genotype efficiently represents all potential solutions that need to be explored to solve the problem.
