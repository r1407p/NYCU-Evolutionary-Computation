## Comparison of Results from Problems 3 and 5

### (1, 1)-ES with Correlated vs. Uncorrelated Mutation:

- **Correlated and Uncorrelated Gaussian Mutations**: Both types of mutation failed to converge to the target within the 10 million iterations allowed for the **(1, 1)-ES** strategy, regardless of the step size. This suggests that neither type of mutation was effective enough in this context to adapt the search process and reach the desired solution.
  
- **Lack of Adaptability in (1, 1)-ES**: The absence of self-adaptive mechanisms in **(1, 1)-ES** reflects a challenge in exploring the solution space. Without the ability to adjust the mutation step dynamically, the algorithm remains highly sensitive to the starting point and initial step size, making it difficult to find an optimal solution. This points to a limitation of the (1, 1)-ES method, as it cannot efficiently explore the space or adapt to the complexity of the optimization task.

### (1 + 1)-ES with Correlated Mutation:

- **Step Size Dependency**: In the case of **correlated mutation** within **(1 + 1)-ES**, the performance was heavily influenced by the step size. Smaller step sizes (σ = 0.01 and 0.1) performed better, with fewer iterations required to converge compared to larger step sizes (σ = 1.0), where convergence was not achieved within the allowed iterations.
  
- **Failure with Larger Step Sizes**: Even with **correlated mutation**, large step sizes (σ = 1.0) failed to produce a result within the maximum iterations. This suggests that the mutation mechanism, while effective for small step sizes, struggled to handle larger step sizes, pointing to an insufficiency in adjusting the mutation step for different stages of the optimization process.

### (1 + 1)-ES with Uncorrelated Mutation:

- **Self-Adaptation in Uncorrelated Mutation**: **Uncorrelated Gaussian mutation**, with its self-adaptive step size mechanism, showed significant improvement over **correlated mutation**. Particularly with smaller and moderate step sizes, the self-adaptive feature allowed the algorithm to converge much faster and with fewer iterations.

- **Better Performance at Smaller Step Sizes**: The self-adaptive mechanism allowed the **(1 + 1)-ES** strategy to fine-tune its mutation step dynamically. This helped the algorithm adapt to the fitness landscape more efficiently, leading to a noticeable improvement in convergence speed, especially when compared to the results from the correlated mutation.

- **Degraded Performance with Larger Step Sizes**: While the self-adaptive uncorrelated mutation showed better performance overall, its effectiveness decreased when using a large step size (σ = 1.0). This still represented an improvement over correlated mutation, though it highlighted that even self-adaptive mechanisms struggle with overly large mutation steps in certain scenarios.

### Self-Adaptation:

- **Self-Adaptation's Role**: The **self-adaptation** seen in **uncorrelated Gaussian mutation** was key to its improved performance in **(1 + 1)-ES**. It allowed the algorithm to adjust the mutation step size dynamically based on the progress in the optimization process. This adaptability helps prevent overshooting the target when large steps are used and allows for finer exploration with smaller steps, helping the algorithm avoid getting stuck in local optima.

- **Advantages of Self-Adaptation**: The ability to adjust the mutation strength as needed enabled the algorithm to strike a balance between exploration (searching broadly across the space) and exploitation (refining the solution). This is particularly useful in complex landscapes where an initial fixed step size may not work well for the entire optimization process.

- **Challenges Without Self-Adaptation**: In contrast, the **(1, 1)-ES** with **correlated mutation** struggled because the algorithm couldn't adjust the step size dynamically. This lack of adaptability made it difficult to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, leading to failure in finding an optimal solution.

### Key Parameters:

- **n = 10**: The dimensionality of the optimization problem, determining the size of the solution vector.
- **max_iterations = 10,000,000**: The upper limit on the number of iterations for the algorithm to reach the target solution.
- **target = 0.005**: The desired value of the objective function (f(x)) that the algorithm aims to achieve.
- **τ (tau) = 1 / np.sqrt(2 * np.sqrt(n))**: A parameter that controls the step size adaptation, ensuring the evolution process is stable and diverse based on the problem's dimensionality.
- **τ' (tau_prime) = 1 / np.sqrt(2 * n)**: Another adaptive parameter for adjusting mutation step sizes globally, based on the dimension of the problem.
- **ε₀ (epsilon) = 1e-6**: A small value that helps prevent numerical issues by avoiding overly small mutation steps and ensuring stable convergence.

### Conclusion:

Self-adaptation, particularly in the case of **uncorrelated Gaussian mutation** within the **(1 + 1)-ES** strategy, provides a more effective and flexible search mechanism than the static mutation step sizes used in **(1, 1)-ES**. By dynamically adjusting the step size, the algorithm is able to explore the solution space more efficiently and avoid issues like overshooting or stagnation, ultimately resulting in faster convergence and better performance.
